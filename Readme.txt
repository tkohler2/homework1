Readme

The file we have been working on is the contours-panda.py. The rest of the files uploaded have been different attempts at pushing and pulling documents. Most of them are unedited from the original opencv program. 

Contours-panda has been modified to create a panda as the generated image, and then use opencv to monitor the contours of the image.
